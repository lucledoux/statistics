<h1>Football Betting Model</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of an application of the Poisson distribution to predict outcomes of football matches. I built it in 2020 for the 2021 season. It is aimed for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 but also for Spanish Ligua 1.

To estimate Î», I collected data on each football match of the 2020 season and accumulated matches while the 2021 season was moving forward. I then used an estimator of the expected value of the number of goals scored in a match to approximate Î».
<br />


<h2>Languages and Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Excel</b> 
- <b>VBA</b>
